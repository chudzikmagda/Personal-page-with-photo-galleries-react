	"intro": "I am a junior <a>frontend developer</a>, a <strong>technical physicist</strong> by education, and in my free time I enjoy good journalism, sightseeing and getting to know the world. However, it is <strong>photography</strong> that has been my greatest passion <strong>since 2010.</strong>",
	"paragraph1": "My adventure with photography has started from<strong> <a>landscapes,</a></strong> mainly from the area of southern Poland and northern Slovakia. Over time, I swayed to <strong><a2>urban photography in black-and-white,</a2></strong> taking pictures in Krakow as well as in the whole East-Central Europe. All along, I have had the desire to look for <strong>minimalism and geometry</strong> around me, follow beauty and capture it in the shot for longer.",
	"paragraph2": "With time, I have been developing as a photographer and mastering my skills in that field, establishing my own style and the way to present reality. I like to re-define my surroundings, frequently showing <strong>simple elements</strong> in an unusual way. In my pieces, I work with <strong>light</strong> and <strong>clear forms,</strong> vesting my photos with a dose of nostalgia. I know that I can find endless sources of inspiration in everyday situations. I constantly set new goals, ambitiously move forward and want to develop further.",
	"paragraph3": "My vision of the world has been recognized in many <strong>photography contests and competitions,</strong> i.e. International Biennial of Landscape Photography in Kielce, Poland (FIAP), International Film and Photography Festival \"The Art of Nature\", Photographic Open Championship Olsztyn, Wojnicz International Salon of Photography (FIAP), International Salon of Photography \"Just one photo\" (FIAP), International Photography Competition \"Landscapes of the World\" (FIAP), Polish National Artistic Photography Salon, International Photographer of the Year, Neutral Density Photography Awards, Tokyo International Photo Awards, and The International Photography Awards. I have also created <strong>two landscape photography exhibitions</strong> <i>\"Magia chwili\"</i> (The Magic of the Moment) and <i>\"Poranne cicho sza\"</i> (The Morning Shush). My photos have appeared at collective exhibitions both in Poland and abroad.",
	"paragraph4": "Photography gives me unlimited room for action. Thanks to it I can express myself and work creatively. It is a process, not only a product. And although I often need to wait long for full satisfaction with my pictures, I appreciate every moment when I can capture the charm of everyday life – unseen by others many a time. Even though I constantly attempt to test new forms, I am still charmed with each and every foggy morning and presenting leisurely, magnificent vibe of that time – in the city and out of town.",
